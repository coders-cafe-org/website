Programming procedural graphics have always been my fascination, especially when I get a glimpse of how such a complicated graphics pipeline interacts with other parts of systems flawlessly to produce a single pixel on your screen. I have played the trumpet and still really loved it. I also have done a few programming projects spanning multiple months, one of them being a simple Minecraft clone. I started programming in 3rd grade in which throughout my years programming, I have always wondered how to expose interesting, unique, and niche Computer Science topics hidden behind the curtain of endless programming tutorials to everyone.
