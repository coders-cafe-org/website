Hello! Currently a high schooler, I enjoy programming in my free times from procedural 3D graphics to machine learning model designing.
Since third grade, I have always loved computer science, not just programming in itself, but also its deeper intrinsic connection with math
and its impact with the world. And now, I want to share my learning experience with kids in our community.
Going out and hiking is also one of my hobby, exploring the world in many different ways.
I also enjoys playing trumpet, and hoping one day I can learn to play French horn.
Big fan of Rustlang!
