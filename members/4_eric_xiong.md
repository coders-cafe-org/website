Hello! my name is Eric. I am a sophomore at Crean Lutheran High School. My free time is usually spent with programing and video games. Ever since I have come here to America, I have been very interested in programing as both a hobby and a career option. Besides programing I am interested in many other stem fields as well. In the future I wish to make an Impact on what ever career I take on.
