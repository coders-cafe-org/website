Hello! My name is Yoseph Kim, and I'm a student attending Beckman High School. My hobbies include playing sports, gaming, and developing my expertise in the field of computer science. Eventually, studying computer science has become a great passion of mine. In Coder's Caf√©, I hope to spread this passion to others through my work in this talented organization.
