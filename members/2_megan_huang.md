Hello hello!! I'm just drifting oolong, seeing where life takes me—and I seem to have found myself as part of the Coder's Cafe. I hope that you all have fun in your own journeys through the world of computer science. After all, I love seeing everyone pursue what they want to pursue—from a mere subject that has caught their eye to their greatest passions. For me, those include graphic design, chemistry, and desserts! Computer science is an interest of mine that I hope will grow more with time and care, as all interests do.
