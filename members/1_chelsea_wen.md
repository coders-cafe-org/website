I'm a high schooler with a large variety of interests from baking, gardening, making spreadsheets, to coding. I enjoy learning about new topics and then spreading this knowledge to other people, especially when it's something I'm passionate about. Besides acting as the Treasurer for Coder's Cafe, I also participate in a few other clubs and organizations, and play the piano.
